      <p class="font white size block">The Neubrite Kingdom (NK) is a minecraft server that allows friends to come together and chill while playing a game that we all enjoy. NK does not have to be limited to mincraft though, we are very much open to other games we could play as a group as well. NK is not just a youtube server but it does not discourage recording in anyway, it is completely up to you. The NK server does have some plug-ins implemented to help with potential greifings, we have added these plug-ins just to be safe, it never hurts to be cautious. The current server owner is Sir_Cam and to help him with the server is his right-hand man KoobyRoory. If you have any questions at all they can be directed towards Cam or Luke or it can be sent to our email: neubritekingdom@gmail.com. Thank you for taking time to look through our site, if you like what you see and want to be apart of it please feel free to apply by clicking the apply button below.
