		<p>The Neubrite Kingdom (NK) is a minecraft server that allows friends to come together and chill while playing a game that we all enjoy. NK does not have to be limited to mincraft though, we are very much open to other games we could play as a group as well. NK is not just a youtube server but it does not discourage recording in anyway, it is completely up to you. The NK server does have some plug-ins implemented to help with potential greifings, we have added these plug-ins just to be safe, it never hurts to be cautious. The current server owner is Sir_Cam98 and to help him with the server is his right-hand man KoobyRoory(Luke). If you have any questions at all they can be directed towards Cam or Luke or it can be sent to our email: neubritekingdom@gmail.com.
